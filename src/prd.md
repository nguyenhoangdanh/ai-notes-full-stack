## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: The design should feel intelligent, reliable, and effortless.
**Design Personality**: Modern, clean, and professional with subtle AI-powered enhancements.
**Visual Metaphors**: Neural networks, knowledge graphs, and seamless connectivity.
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that reveals power when needed.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with purple-blue base
**Primary Color**: Deep purple (oklch(0.45 0.15 260)) - intelligence and creativity
**Secondary Colors**: Light purple-grey (oklch(0.85 0.08 260)) - subtlety and sophistication  
**Accent Color**: Warm amber (oklch(0.7 0.15 45)) - highlights and success states
**Color Psychology**: Purple conveys intelligence and creativity, while amber provides warmth and energy.

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) with varied weights
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body, and UI text
**Font Personality**: Clean, modern, and highly legible
**Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700) for consistency and readability

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Content-first with progressive disclosure of features
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing for clarity and focus
**Grid System**: 4px base unit with 8px spacing scale
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with adaptive layouts

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: shadcn/ui for consistency and accessibility
**Component Customization**: Minimal customization to maintain design system integrity
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for comprehensive and consistent iconography
**Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly sizing with 44px minimum targets

## Implementation Considerations

### API Integration Architecture
- Complete TypeScript type generation from backend contracts
- Centralized API client with automatic authentication
- React Query for caching and synchronization
- Proper error handling and retry logic

### Offline Strategy
- Service Worker for asset caching
- IndexedDB for data persistence
- Conflict resolution for sync
- Background sync capabilities

### Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Time to Interactive: <3s
- Offline functionality: 100% core features

### Mobile PWA Features
- Install prompt
- Push notifications
- Background sync
- Native-like navigation

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for components
- React Query for state management
- Framer Motion for animations

### Data Flow
1. API Client → Services → React Query Hooks → Components
2. Offline: IndexedDB → Sync Service → API Client
3. Real-time: WebSocket/SSE → Context → Components

### File Structure

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

### Offline Conflicts
- Multiple device edits
- Merge strategies for conflicts
- User resolution interface

### Network Issues
- Partial sync failures
- Retry mechanisms
- User feedback for sync status

### Authentication Edge Cases
- Token expiration during offline use
- OAuth callback handling
- Concurrent session management

## Reflection

This approach creates a production-ready frontend that fully leverages the sophisticated backend architecture while providing an exceptional mobile-first user experience. The focus on offline capabilities and real-time AI integration makes this solution uniquely powerful for modern note-taking needs.

The comprehensive API integration ensures all backend features are accessible, while the PWA architecture provides reliability and performance that rivals native applications.
